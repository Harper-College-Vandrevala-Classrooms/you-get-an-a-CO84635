In order to use the grade book, first create a new gradebook object.
Next, add students with the add_student method on that gradebook; it requires the following arguments: the student's full name and their student ID. Next, in order to add assignments, call the add_assignment method, which requires the assignment name and the total score. To enter the grade for that assignment, call the enter_grade method. This will require the following arguments: the student's full name that you want to add the grade to, the name of the assignment, and the score that that student received. All three of these methods can be called as many times as required, with feedback if something has gone wrong along the way. In order to print out the report of the grades, take the original gradebook object and simply call the report method. This will return a nicely formatted list of students, IDs, and each of the grades they received for all of the assignments created. I hope you find this tool useful!
